Q.5 List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth ?

In Database Management Systems (DBMS), classification can be based on various criteria, including data models, structure, and no. of user. Here are some common types of classifications in DBMS:

1.Based on Data Models:

    Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, establishing relationships between tables. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

    Hierarchical DBMS (HDBMS): Represents data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a parent-child relationship. IMS (Information Management System) is an example of a hierarchical DBMS.

    Network DBMS (NDBMS): Extends the hierarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships. The CODASYL database management system is an example of a network DBMS.

    Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS): Stores data in the form of objects, which can include both data and procedures. It is suitable for applications with complex data structures and relationships.

2.Based on Structure:

    Centralized DBMS: In a centralized database system, a single server is responsible for managing and storing the entire database. It provides centralized control over data management.

    Distributed DBMS (DDBMS): Distributes data across multiple servers or locations. It offers advantages like improved performance and fault tolerance but also introduces challenges related to data consistency and coordination.

3.Based on Number of Users:

    Single-user DBMS: Designed for a single user or a small group of users. Personal database systems like Microsoft Access are examples of single-user DBMS.

    Multi-user DBMS: Supports concurrent access by multiple users. It ensures data consistency and integrity in a shared environment. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
