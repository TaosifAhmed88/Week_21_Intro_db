Q.4 Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS ?

Challenges tackled by DBMS are as follows:

1.Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

    Challenge in File-Based Systems: In file-based systems, the same data could be duplicated across multiple files, leading to redundancy.
    Updates made to one copy might not be reflected in other copies, resulting in inconsistency.

    DBMS Solution: DBMS organizes data into tables with predefined structures, enforcing data integrity rules.
    Redundancy is minimized, and updates are centralized, reducing the risk of inconsistency.

2.Data Isolation:

    Challenge in File-Based Systems: Data isolation occurred because related information was often stored in separate files, making it difficult to establish connections and retrieve comprehensive datasets.

    DBMS Solution: DBMS allows the creation of relationships between tables, enabling the retrieval of related data through queries. This eliminates the isolation problem and enhances data connectivity.

3.Limited Data Integrity Enforcement:

    Challenge in File-Based Systems: File systems lacked built-in mechanisms to enforce data integrity constraints, such as ensuring unique values or maintaining referential integrity between related data.

    DBMS Solution: DBMS provides tools for defining and enforcing data integrity rules. 
    It ensures that data meets predefined criteria, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving overall data quality.

4.Difficulty in Data Retrieval and Querying:

    Challenge in File-Based Systems: Retrieving specific information from file-based systems often required manual searching through various files. Querying capabilities were limited.

    DBMS Solution: DBMS introduces a standardized query language (e.g., SQL) and query optimization techniques. Users can easily retrieve and manipulate data using queries, making data access more efficient and flexible.

5.Concurrency Control Issues:

    Challenge in File-Based Systems: Concurrent access and updates by multiple users in file-based systems could lead to data inconsistencies and conflicts.

    DBMS Solution: DBMS incorporates concurrency control mechanisms to manage simultaneous transactions. 
    It ensures that transactions are executed in a way that maintains data consistency and integrity, even in a multi-user environment.
