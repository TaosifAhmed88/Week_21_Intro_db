Q.1 What is a Database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database?


A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to manage, retrieve, and update.

Databases are used to store data in a structured format, typically organized into tables with rows and columns. 

The data within a database can be related to each other, and the database management system (DBMS) ensures that the data remains consistent, accurate, and easily accessible.

Common database types include relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) and NoSQL databases (e.g.MongoDB.)

Example to illustrate the need for a database:

Imagine a business that sells products and needs to keep track of inventory, customer information, and sales transactions. Without a database, this information might be scattered across various spreadsheets, text files, or even paper records. This decentralized approach could lead to several issues:

1.Data Redundancy: The same information may be duplicated in multiple places, leading to inconsistencies,errors.

2.Data Security: Protecting data becomes more challenging without a centralized system, making it susceptible to unauthorized access or loss.

3.Limited Scalability: As the volume of data grows, managing it becomes increasingly difficult with decentralized storage.
