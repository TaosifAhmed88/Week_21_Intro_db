Q.3 What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS ?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface for interacting with databases. 

It is a centralized system that enables users to create, manage, and manipulate databases, ensuring the efficient and secure storage, retrieval, and modification of data. 

The primary functions of a DBMS include data definition, data manipulation, data retrieval, and data integrity enforcement.

The development and adoption of Database Management Systems (DBMS) were driven by several factors addressing challenges associated with file-based storage systems. Here are some key reasons for the need for DBMS:

1.Data Centralization: In traditional file systems, data was scattered across various files and locations, leading to difficulties in accessing and managing information.

2.Data Independence: Changes in the structure of data or in the application software often required extensive modifications to existing files in file-based systems.

3.Concurrent Access: In file-based systems, managing simultaneous access and updates by multiple users could lead to data inconsistencies and conflicts.

4.Query Language and Optimization: Retrieving information from file-based systems often required manual searching, and querying capabilities were limited.

5.Scalability and Performance: File-based systems faced scalability issues as data volume increased, leading to inefficiencies in data management.
