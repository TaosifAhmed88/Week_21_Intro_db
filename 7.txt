Q.7 Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages ?


The Three Schema Architecture is a conceptual framework that divides a database system into three interrelated components or schemas. These schemas represent different views of the database, each tailored for specific purposes. The three schemas are:

1.User Schema (External Schema):

        -The User Schema represents the way data is viewed by individual users or groups of users. 
        -It focuses on the specific data and information needed by a particular user or application.
        -Users interact with the database through the User Schema, which provides a customized and simplified view of the data relevant to their tasks or queries.
        -Each user or application may have a unique view of the data, defined by the External Schema.

2.Logical Schema (Conceptual Schema):

        -The Logical Schema represents the logical structure of the entire database without detailing how data is physically stored or accessed.
        -It defines the relationships, constraints, and integrity rules that govern the entire database. 
        -The Logical Schema provides a high-level, conceptual view of the data model.
        -Changes to the Logical Schema affect the entire database and require consideration of the overall structure and relationships.

3.Internal Schema (Physical Schema):

        -The Internal Schema describes how data is physically stored and accessed on the underlying hardware or storage devices.
        -It includes details such as file organization, indexing mechanisms, and data storage structures.
        -The Internal Schema is concerned with optimizing data storage and retrieval for efficient performance.
        -Changes to the Internal Schema do not affect the Logical or User Schemas. This separation allows for modifications to the physical storage without impacting the logical structure or user views.

Advantages are as follows:

1.Data Independence:

        The Three Schema Architecture provides a clear separation between the User Schema, Logical Schema, and Internal Schema. This separation promotes data independence at different levels:

        -Physical Data Independence: Changes to the Internal Schema (storage structure) do not affect the Logical or User Schemas. Applications and users remain unaffected by alterations to the physical storage.

        -Logical Data Independence: Changes to the Logical Schema (conceptual structure) do not impact the User Schemas. Modifications to the data model are transparent to users and applications.

2.Flexibility and Customization:

        -Users and applications can have their own customized views of the data through the User Schema. 
        -This allows for flexibility and customization, as different users can interact with the database based on their specific requirements without affecting the overall database structure.

3.Enhanced Security :

        -The Three Schema Architecture facilitates the implementation of access controls and security measures at different levels. 
        -Security policies can be applied to restrict access at the User Schema level, ensuring that users only have access to the data they need for their tasks.

4.Concurrent Development:

        -The separation of schemas enables concurrent development by different teams or individuals. 
        -Changes to the User Schema, for example, can be made independently of changes to the Logical or Internal Schemas, promoting parallel development efforts.
