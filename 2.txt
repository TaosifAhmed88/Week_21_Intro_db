Q.2 Write a short note on File base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system ?

A file-based storage system is a way to use files to organize and store data.

Each file holds information about a particular application or entity.

Using this method, programs communicate with data files to read and write data. Data is saved in files.

Typically, files lack an intrinsic structure or relationship, and each one may have its own format.

In contrast, data in a database system is arranged into tables with predetermined relationships and structures.

Challenges:->
1.Data Redundancy: There could be redundant copies of the same data in several files, which could cause redundancy and raise the possibility of data being inconsistent.

2.Scalability Issues: The complexity of managing and organizing files increases with the volume of data.

3.Concurrency Control: Handling simultaneous access and updates by multiple users can be problematic without proper concurrency control mechanisms.

4.Difficulty in Data Retrieval: Retrieving specific pieces of information requires manual searching through files, making the process time-consuming and inefficient.
